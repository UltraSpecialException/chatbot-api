# chatbot

My currently in development UofT Chatbot - Your friendly UofT Buddy who provides you with information for your convenience. Ask it for food places or parking near campus, or courses with a certain key word or free rooms.

The information I get is gathered from the UofT Cobalt API (courtesy to its writer(s)). The free rooms I learned to scrape information from UofT's study spot website (github page found here: https://github.com/urdaalex/uoftstudyspot). A lot of the code for the scraper are probably almost identical as there is no other way I would know to write it. 

This is the API for the chatbot, currently set up for Facebook Messenger. Soon to come: web-widget/phone application
